Growing and Shrinking

    What are the 3 values defined in the shorthand flex property (e.g. flex: 1 1 auto)?
    - flex-grow, flex-shrink, flex-basis

Axes

    How do you make flex items arrange themselves vertically instead of horizontally?
    - flex-direction: column

    In a column flex-container, what does flex-basis refer to?
    - flex-basis refers to the starting calculation of height

    In a row flex-container, what does flex-basis refer to?
    - width calculation

    Why do the previous two questions have different answers?

JS Fundamentals 1

    Name the three ways to declare a variable?
    - var, let, const
    
    Which of the three variable declarations should you avoid and why?
    - var, since it is an old feature and has a slightly different effect compared to let

    What rules should you follow when naming variables?
    - alphanumeric and $ _ are available, no numbers at start of variable name, variables should be descriptive and useful for context purposes, camelCase is used for 1+ word variables, variables are case-sensitive, reserved names will never work as variable names

    What should you look out for when using the + operator with numbers and strings?
    - binary + sign concatenates strings and numbers, if there are three or more operands then the operation will be run from left to right.

    How does the % operator work?
    - divides two operands, then returns the remainder

    Explain the difference between == and ===.
    - === takes data types into account when comparing, == doesn't

    When would you receive a NaN result?
    - when doing arithmetic with a non-numeric string (except +), or when used as a value for an arithmetic operation with other operands as numbers

    How do you increment and decrement a number?
    - ++ or --

    Explain the difference between prefixing and post-fixing increment/decrement operators.
    - prefixing returns the new value, post-fixing returns the old value. if the result of increment/decrement isn't used, there's no difference

    What is operator precedence and how is it handled in JS?
    - operator precedence is established based on the mathematical rules of operations.

    What is the relationship between null and undefined?
    - null signifies that a variable is empty, undefined indicates that a variable is not assigned a value;

    What is the difference between single, double, and backtick quotes for strings?
    - single and double quotes are similar, backtick quotes are used for including variables and expressions inside strings in the form of ${} and new lines are automatically detected as they are typed in the source code in contrast to single and double quotes where you need to type \n to indicate a new line.
    
    What is the term for embedding variables/expressions in a string?
    - template literal

    Which type of quote lets you embed variables/expressions in a string?
    - backtick quotes

    How do you embed variables/expressions in a string?
    - ${}

    - \name

    What are methods?
    - feature for a data type to be manipulated like with strings

    What is the difference between slice/substring/substr?
    - slice can have positive and negative values, substring can only have positives, substr specifies the length of the extracted part via the second numerical argument

    What are the three logical operators and what do they stand for?
    - && AND, || OR, ! NOT 

    What are the comparison operators?
    - == === !== != >= <= > <

    What are truthy and falsy values?
    - truthy values are values that will return true when evaluated as boolean, falsy values are values that return false when evaluated as boolean

    What are the falsy values in JavaScript?
    - null, undefined, 0, false, NaN, '' (empty string)

    What are conditionals?
    - if/else, switch case, code blocks that run depending on the boolean expression or value condition when evaluated.

    What is the syntax for an if/else conditional?
    - if (condition) { run code } else { run code }

    What is the syntax for a switch statement?
    - switch (value) {
        case 1: 
            code here
            break;
        case 2:
            code here
            break;
        default:
            code here
            break;
    }

    What is the syntax for a ternary operator?
    - condition ? value returned for true : value returned for false

    What is nesting?
    - when you put an if block inside an if block, or when you put a switch block inside a switch block.

JS Dev tools

    How do you open developer tools?
    - ctrl shift c / ctrl shift j / ctrl shift i / f12 / right click > inspect

    How do you change screen size of a website using developer tools?

    How do you set a breakpoint?
    - clicking a number from the left of the script or element line, toggling event listener breakpoints, entering 'debugging;' code in the source

JS FUndamentals 3

    What are functions useful for?
    - functions are useful for organizing code actions into a single block, and calling on them in the main code flow only when needed. Functions saves time by eliminating the need to recreate same code over and over

    How do you invoke a function?
    - functionName();

    What are anonymous functions?
    - functions with no name

    What is function scope?
    - function scope is when a variable is declared inside a function, that variable is only available for reference inside that function. global variables can be used inside functions.

    What are return values?
    - return values are what code blocks or usually functions give back after being evaluated or called

    What are arrow functions?
    - arrow functions is a new type of syntax for functions that improves code readability and offers more use cases for function expressions

JS Problem Solving

    What are the three stages in the problem solving process?
    - Understand the problem, plan, pseudocode

    Why is it important to clearly understand the problem first?
    - to identify what variables are involved and what methods are needed when planning

    What can you do to help get a clearer understanding of the problem?
    - write on a paper, explain to someone else in plain english, make a diagram
    
    What are some of the things you should do in the planning stage of the problem solving process?
    - answer questions like what are the inputs, what are the outputs, is there an interface, what is/are the process/es to arrive at the output

    What is an algorithm?
    - a single or series of calculations and commands that the computer will put into action to have the desired output

    What is pseudocode?
    - pseudocode are sentences made by the programmer to outline the process to be done in the program, eventually translated into code

    What are the advantages of breaking a problem down and solving the smaller problems?
    - focusing down on simpler problems stemmed from the big problem allow for an easier problem solving 

JS Understanding Errors

    What are three reasons why you may see a TypeError?
    - the data type is not being used as intended, when an function or operator does not receive the expected data type, when attempting to modify a value that cannot be changed

    What is the key difference between an error and a warning?
    - an error stops the program from running or stops in the middle of the script, a warning displays information that might be insightful to the programmer

    What is one method you can use to resolve an error?
    - debugging

JS Clean Code

    Why is it important to write clean code?
    - to easily recall what the codes are written for when one comes back to it after a while, to make sure that other developers can easily pick up on what the codes are all about.

    Name 5 clean code principles previously mentioned
    - revise logic before coding by pseudocode or diagrams or other methods possible, write effective comments, avoid abusing comments, break large functions into smaller pieces, make structure obvious through proper element or variable naming, use indents wisely, treat changes with caution

    What is the difference between good comments and bad comments?
    - comments only become good ones when you've exhausted all possible methods to make the code as easy to read as possible without comments, comments become bad when they are unnecessary, blames other developers, states the obvious role of the code, overexplains, or purposeless block of code that has been commented out without being removed after deployment.

JS Fundamentals 4

    What is an array?
    - array is a collection of values enclosed in brackets and separated by comma

    What are arrays useful for?
    - arrays are useful for containing values of different data types in a single variable, and manipulate them using array and string methods

    What are some useful array methods?
    - array.length, array.join, array.splice, array.push

    What are loops useful for?
    - for finding or manipulating a specific value in the array especially if it contains numerous elements

    What is the break statement?
    - break statement allows a loop to exit from the code block

    What is the continue statement?
    - continue statement stops the current iteration in the loop and ignores the next lines of codes and runs the next iteration

    What is the advantage of writing automated tests?
    - eliminates the need to test a code multiple times manually
